### Description
A small voxel renderer written in C++ 23 using OpenGL.
Look in the `rewrite` branch for an improved codebase with fewer implemented features, as listed below.
I've made this list to establish a clear goal for when I consider this project finished.

## Feature list
- [x] 3D rendering
- [x] Movement
- [ ] Block placement and removal
- [ ] Physics
- [ ] Chunks
- [ ] World Generation
- [ ] Saving and loading of worlds
